### tutorial - Read through

**To write:**

- half-page abstract/summary of the entire tutorial in the beginning
- "pre-introduction": js is standardized by ecma, bla bla, engines, bla bla, spidermonkey
- troubleshooting during installation (mozilla unified, ecmarkup)
- some introductory text in the beginning of the "Implementation" https://github.com/bldl/emplace-spidermonkey?tab=readme-ov-file#implementation
- "inter"-text where you have "dry"/terse blocks of code: https://github.com/bldl/emplace-spidermonkey?tab=readme-ov-file#implement-the-first-line
- intro about ecmarkup before https://github.com/bldl/emplace-spidermonkey?tab=readme-ov-file#writing-the-new-spec-in-ecmarkup
- intro before https://github.com/bldl/emplace-spidermonkey?tab=readme-ov-file#implementing-the-new-proposal
- write the finished version of the new spec in the end of https://github.com/bldl/emplace-spidermonkey?tab=readme-ov-file#implementing-the-new-proposal


**Fixes:**

- the original spec text currently missing (in the tutorial), only referenced

**Small fixes:**

- backticks for code
- add links Wikipedia style
- proposal Upsert (fix everywhere where emplace is used now)
- remove phrases like "we advise you to ..."
- screenshots
- How to read ...: add link to https://timothygu.me/es-howto/ , https://v8.dev/blog/tags/understanding-ecmascript
- Fix this: "You’ll often see steps like “If X is true...” which means that JavaScript checks something, and the next steps depend on the result."
- double check item 5 of "How to read ..."
- sudo -> pseudo
- fix "When implementing a feature, Searchfox is a powerful tool."
- keep the text style formal (no exclamation marks etc.)
- capitalize the headers, subheaders etc. where necessary
- selfhosted -> self-hosted
- "How to translate from ECMAscript to ecmarkup" -> "How to format spec text using ecmarkup"
- som -> some
- ECMAscript -> ECMAScript®
- javascript -> JavaScript™

**TODO:**

- migrate to github pages
- HTML-rich navigation (e.g., playground)
- fix https://github.com/bldl/emplace-spidermonkey?tab=readme-ov-file#implement-the-first-line
- tabs for cases like these: https://github.com/bldl/emplace-spidermonkey?tab=readme-ov-file#writing-the-new-spec-in-ecmarkup
- diagram of the tutorial
