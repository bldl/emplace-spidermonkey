# Old vs. New Version of `Map.prototype.emplace`

## Overview:
- Old Version: The old version of the emplace method focused on providing a flexible and powerful 
tool for managing Map entries with separate insert and update callbacks, allowing for both insertions 
and updates to be handled distinctly within a single method call.

- New Version: The new version simplifies the emplace method by focusing on the most common use case: 
inserting a default value if the key is absent and returning the existing value otherwise. Additionally, 
a DefaultMap class is introduced, which provides a similar functionality but with automatic value 
generation via a callback for missing keys.

## Key Changes:
### API Simplification:

- Old Version: Supported both insert and update operations with distinct callbacks, allowing for flexible 
handling of Map entries.
- New Version: Focuses on a single callback mechanism, optimizing the API for the common case where only 
insertion (with a default value) is needed if the key is missing.

### Introduction of DefaultMap:

- Old Version: Did not include a DefaultMap.
- New Version: Introduces DefaultMap, a specialized Map that automatically inserts a value generated by a 
callback when a key is missing.

### Handling of Re-entrancy:

- Old Version: Detailed consideration of re-entrancy and its implications on Map operations.
- New Version: This aspect is left to be finalized (marked as TODO), indicating a shift in focus toward simpler 
use cases.

### Examples and Use Cases:

- Old Version: Provided multiple complex examples showing different scenarios where emplace could be used, emphasizing 
the flexibility of handling both inserts and updates.
- New Version: Simplifies examples, focusing primarily on the insertion of default values and the convenience 
of using DefaultMap.

### Pros and Cons:
Old Version:
- Pros:
    - Flexibility: Provides detailed control over both insertion and updating, allowing for complex and tailored operations.
    - Rich Functionality: Extensive API supporting a wide range of use cases.

- Cons:
    - Complexity: The API is more complex, with multiple callbacks, making it potentially harder to learn and use.
    - Overhead: Handling both insert and update operations can introduce unnecessary overhead in cases where only 
    insertion is required.

New Version:
- Pros:
    - Simplicity: Streamlines the API, focusing on the most common use caseâ€”handling missing keys with a default value.
    - Ease of Use: Easier to understand and implement, especially with the addition of DefaultMap for automatic handling 
    of missing keys.

- Cons:
    - Reduced Flexibility: Loses some of the flexibility of the old version by removing distinct insert/update callbacks.
    - Limited Scenarios: May not cover all advanced scenarios that the old version could handle, especially those 
    requiring distinct handling for updates.

Conclusion:
The transition from the old proposal to the new proposal of emplace reflects a shift towards simplicity and ease of 
use, prioritizing common use cases over the comprehensive flexibility offered by the old version. The introduction 
of DefaultMap further enhances usability for scenarios involving missing keys, making the API more accessible to 
developers while keeping the most important functionality.
